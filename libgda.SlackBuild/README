libgda was part of the GNOME-DB project (http://www.gnome.org/projects/gnome-db),
but has been separated from it to allow non-GNOME applications to be
developed based on it.

The libgda library is released under the terms of the LGPL license,  which
allows for commercial applications to be developed based on libgda. Its 
command-line and UI tools are under the GPL.

See COPYING for the GPL license.
